# ‚òéÔ∏è Answering Machine

This is a small demo which tray's to simulate an automated answering machine build on top of Amazon Connect and AWS Lex. Basically this stack pushes to the limit what you can do with Amazon Connect, since Connect was never designed to a scnraio like this, But since at 0x4447 we do like to test the limits of what the cloud has to offer - we did it anyway, to see where the stack brakes. Enjoy the read.

# Overview

### AWS Lex

Lex is the AWS service that powers Amazon Alexa, a Machine Learning model that tries to understand the human voice by extracting the intent in the detected voice. The result can be received by a AWS Lambda, or directivity sent back to Amazon Connect. This allows us to create dynamic call flow based on what a user says back.

### Amazon Connect

Is a virtual call center service, that allows you co create phone call flows based on the user input, time of the day, active agents and more. This means that when someone calls a phone number that you bought, you can screen the caller with a basic number wall where they chose the right option for them. Or if we combine Connect with Lex, the caller can actually talk back, based on questions that we ask them.

# All together

On top of this two services, if we add a bunch of Lambda functions, we gain complete control over Lex and Connect, and can:

- intercept actions from Lex, and
- get notified by Connect of all the interactions with the caller.

This way we can Ask for the caller name if we don't have it in the database, or greet them with their name if the calling number have a matching name.


# DISCLAIMER!

This stack is available to anyone at no cost, but on an as-is basis. 0x4447 LLC is not responsible for damages or costs of any kind that may occur when you use the stack. You take full responsibility when you use it.

# How to deploy

<a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=zer0x4447-S3-Email&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/0x4447-drive-cloudformation/answering-machine.json">
<img align="left" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png"></a>

All you need to do to deploy this stack is click the button to the left and follow the instructions that CloudFormation provides in your AWS Dashboard. Alternatively you can download the CF file from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/0x4447-drive-cloudformation/answering-machine.json).

# What will deploy?

![Answering Machine Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x4447/0x4447_product_answering_machine/assets/diagram.png)

The stack takes advantage of AWS S3, AWS SES, AWS Lambda, and the AWS Trigger system to tie everything together. You'll get:

- 4x AWS Lambdas (1x CodeBuild and 1x CodePipeline for each Lambda to support auto-deployment)
- 1x DynamoDB table

All project resources can be found [here](https://github.com/topics/0x4447-product-answering-machine).

# Auto deploy

The stack is set up in a such a way that any time new code is pushed to a selected branch, the CodePipeline picks up the change and updates the Lambdas for you. These are the available branches:

- **master**: the latest stable code
- **development**: unstable code that we test in our test environment - we don't recommend that you use this branch

# Manual work

Sadly at the time of writing this Lex and Connect are not supported by CloudFormation, this means that once the stack is deployed you will configure this two services by hand.

### AWS Lex

1. Go to the [Lex console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lex/home).
1. Click the blue button `Create`.
	1. Select `Custom bot`.
	1. Type the name of your bot.
	1. Select an `Output voice` that you like. Joanna seams the more natural of them all.
	1. Set 5 min in the `Session timeout` field.
	1. And select No for the `COPPA` section.
	1. Click `Create`.
1. Now, on the new page, click `Create Intent`
	1. On the popup select `Create intent`.
	1. Name it `GetName`
	1. In the `Slots` section we need first to create a new entry called `first_name`. With a `Slot type` of `AMAZON.US_FIRST_NAME`, and with `Prompt` set as `Can I have your name`.
	1. Now that we have the Slot, in the `Sample utterances`, we are going to write a bunch of possible sentences a caller can say. You can come up with more if you'd like:
		1. `Yes sure my name is ‚Äã{first_name}‚Äã`
		1. `I'm ‚Äã{first_name}‚Äã`
		1. `My name is ‚Äã{first_name}‚Äã`
		1. `‚Äã{first_name}‚Äã`
1. We are going to make another Intent, this time called `message`.
	1. For the `Slots` we are going to type `message`.
	1. For the `Slot type` we are going to select: `AMAZON.Festival` because we want the most general type possible, since we want to get the whole voice transcript, and not let Lex try to understand the meaning of what was said.
	1. For `Prompt`, type anything, since Lex won't be asking the question, we are going to fulfill the intent using our custom Lambda.
	1. For `Sample utterances`, write just one: ‚Äã`{message}‚Äã`.
	1. For `Lambda initialization and validation`, select the Message Lambda, and do the same for ` Fulfillment`, where you select `AWS Lambda function`, and the Message lambda from the drop down.
	1. On the same page, from the left menu select `Error Handling`.
		1. For `Clarification prompts`, type something like:
			1. `Sorry, I didn't hear you.`
			1. `What's that?`
			1. `Could you please repeat that?`
		1. Set the `Maximum number of retries` to 5,
		1. And for the `Hang-up phrase` write: `Sorry, the connection is to bad. Please go to our contact page to send us an email.`
1. On the Setting page, go to `Aliases`, and create an alias named `production` and select the latest `Bot version`. This alias is important since it is going to be used by Amazon Connect. This way you can even edit your bot while Connect uses the version you have set, and switch to the new one once you are done testing.

### Amazon Connect

1. Go to the [Connect console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/home).
1. Click the blue `Add an instance` button.
	1. Check `Store users within Amazon Connect`, and write the name for the `Access URL`, and then click `Next step`.
	1. On the `Create an Administrator` page, fill out the form for a new admin user - this has nothing to do with a IAM user. Once ready click `Next step`.
	1. On the `Telephony Options` check all the options if you want, then click `Next step`.
	1. Keep the `Data storage` page as is by clicking `Next step`.
	1. Review the setup and once ready click `Create instance`
1. Click on your new Connect setup, and on the left menu, at the bottom, click `Contact flows`.
	1. In the `Amazon Lex` section select the region where you created the bot.
	1. From the `Bot` drop dow menu, select the Lex bot we created in the previous setup.

After all of this we have Lex linked with Connect. And this page whee you are on is only used manage the general Connect settings, the whole flow setup of an incoming phone call is done through a separate page. To access this page you have to follow the link you created in section `3`, and use the credentials created in section `4`.

### Amazon Connect Flow

![Call Flow](https://github.com/0x4447/0x4447_product_answering_machine/blob/assets/call_flow.png)

This part of the setup is the most involved since it will require you to edit a JSON file to update it to your setup. But before we do that, let's start with the basic.

1. Use the URL that you created to access the Connect dashboard.
1. Once logged in, hover over the 3th icon from the left menu, and select: `Contact flows`.
1. On the `Contact flows` page, click ` Create contact flow`.
1. On the new page, name your flow, for example `Offcie`.

At this stage you can download our [contact flow that we create](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x4447/0x4447_product_answering_machine/assets/call_flow.json). This is the file that you'll have to edit, and replace some ARNs to lambda functions to your owns. Sadly there isn't an automatic way of doing this.

Once the file is changed you can import the flow: at the top right corner you have the `Save` button, which has an arrow pointing down. Click on it and select `Import flow (beta)`. Select the file, and upload it.

# How to work with this project

When you want to deploy the stack, the only file you should be interested in is the `CloudFormation.json` file. If you'd like to modify the stack, we recommend that you use the [Grapes framework](https://github.com/0x4447/0x4447-cli-node-grapes), which was designed to make it easier to work with the CloudFormation file. If you'd like to keep your sanity, never edit the main CF file ü§™.
